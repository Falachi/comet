# THE AMAZING NON-AI-POWERED NON-BROWSING DESKTOP APPLICATION

## Features:

- Cool comet that is all black and white type
- A button to satisfy your TikTok/YouTube Shorts brain (with sound!)
- Nothing coming soon!

## Building

1. Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Falachi/comet.git
cd comet
```

2. Enter the Python environment and install dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

3. Run the pyinstaller in a terminal. The built app should be in `/dist/`

```bash
# On Linux/macOS, replace ';' with ':'
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "assets/click.mp3;." --add-data "assets/comet.gif;." --windowed --name comet  main.py
```

4. Realize you could've just downloaded it from the Release page.

5. Definitely do **not** put it in the directory `Perplexity/Comet/Application/` and accept the quest on Discord.

6. Enjoy!
